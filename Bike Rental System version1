Hello
This is a Bike Rental System that has a few bikes parked at designated spots across the city. This will be an android application which will provide both sharing and rental service. A key aspect of this system is that it does not involve intermediaries between users and bike: reserving, acquiring and releasing a bike are all done automatically through software running on the system of the user's smartphone. Each bike has a unique barcode that must be scanned through a mobile application. This connects the bike to the user’s mobile via bluetooth.
Also individuals owning bikes can lend to other users. It will provide bikes for short-term trips on sharing basis and bike on rent. A typical bike-sharing system includes a communal stock of sturdy, low-maintenance bikes distributed over a network of parking stations.
